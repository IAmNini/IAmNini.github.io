          <p>I am a Software Engineer with skills both in the front end and in the back end. I graduated from university
            with a degree in Economics and Management, but my passion for problem solving and logic quickly directed me
            towards a career in software development. I decided to take the Software Engineering Immersive course at
            General Assembly, where I learned how to build full-stack applications with JavaScript, Express, React,
            Python and Django. I am very excited to start working as a developer.</p>
          <h5>Education</h5>
          <h6>Codecademy, Online, Oct 2019-Feb 2020</h6>
          <p>Completed the following courses: “Core Foundations”, “Learn How to Build Websites”, and started career path
            “Web Development”.</p>

          <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows and reading books of many different genres and from
            all over the world. Languages and cultures being a passion of mine, I also use movies, TV and books to
            connect with other countries and learn more about them. I also practice my languages this way. I also like
            dancing and choreographing in different genres.</p>

          <p>At GA, we had four main projects that we completed throughout the course:</p>

          <p>Project 4 - HelloCode (1 week): This last project was in a team of 4. We decided to build a chat
            functionality in our app, which proved to be very challenging because we used web-sockets and had to learn a
            whole new skill. We were very ambitious in general with this project because we took on 4 new technologies,
            Django, Channels, Hooks, and Material-UI, so we spent a lot of time debugging. I spent more time on the
            front end, and with Material-UI, but also built the initial models and serializers in the back end for our
            languages and users. We all worked together a lot on this project, we all kind of participated in many
            things and helped each other. HelloCode is an app where coders can find people who know the languages
            they’re learning at can help each other with coding issues!

          <p>Project 3 - Trivia Game (10 days): This project was in teams of 4, and was our first full-stack app. We
            used
            React in the front end and MongoDB and Express in the back end. We made a trivia game using an external API
            called OpenTriviaDB with questions and answers, and stored user information, scores and comments in our own
            database. We divided tasks between team members. I mainly worked on the front end logic for the questions
            and answers. It was good because we all got to practice our skills both in the front end and in the back
            end. I found out through this project that building the game logic in the front end is something I really
            enjoy. We made this app mobile view first, since most people would probably open this game from their
            phones.

          <p>Project 2 - SpaceX Launches (2 days): This project was in pairs. My partner and I, being both space
            enthusiasts, decided to use SpaceX’s API to make an app that displays past and future launches. We used
            JavaScript, Webpack, React, Insomnia and Bulma in our app. We matched missing data from the API with images
            and descriptions of our own. We learned a lot about API structuring, which was helpful for future projects
            where we had our own back end.

          <p>Project 1 - Pac-Man (1 week): This first project was a solo project where we had to build a game of
            Pac-Man, similar to the original, but with a few personal changes. I used HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to
            build this game. I did all of the logic and all of the styling, as well as a background story animation.
